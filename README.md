## üöÄ How to Run the Application

### Virtual Environment Setup

A Virtual Environment is necessary to develop and test the application. This is performed in a safe, self-contained manner through Python's Virtual Environment.
This project uses a .env file to manage environment variables, especially for sensitive information.

### 1. Initialise a Python Virtual Environment

Ensure that your current working directory contains the `requirements.txt`
file, in this case it is '/venv', then use:

`$ python -m venv venv`

NOTE: Your system may have `python3` aliased as something other than `python`

### 2. Activate the new Virtual Environment

On standard Unix operating systems this would be:

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

On Windows systems:

`$ venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the Python dependencies that the application requires to run. These can be downloaded and installed with:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

NOTE: Your system may have `pip3` aliased as something other than `pip`.


### 4. Start the server

To start the server and open pages in our browser, the follow command should be executed:

`flask run`

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050/). If you want to modify the port number, you can modify it in `.flaskenv` and
`pip install python-dotenv`.

## üß™ How to Run Tests

### Running Tests

NutriMate uses both unit tests (pytest) and UI tests (Selenium) to ensure application quality and functionality. Our comprehensive test suite covers models, routes, forms, and user interface interactions.

### 1. Setup Testing Environment

First, install the required testing packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: `requirements.txt` already includes `pytest`, `selenium` and other testing dependencies.

### 2. Running All Tests (Unit + Selenium)

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Or alternatively:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

### 3. Running Only Unit Tests

To run only the unit tests:

```bash
pytest tests/unit
```

Or alternatively:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit
```

Unit tests cover:

- Database models validation
- Form validation logic
- Utility functions
- Route handlers
- Authentication functionality

### 4. Running Only Selenium Tests

To run only the UI/integration tests with Selenium:

```bash
pytest tests/selenium -m selenium
```

Or alternatively:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/selenium -m selenium
```

Selenium tests cover:

- User registration and login flows
- Meal plan creation process
- Data upload functionality
- Visualization interactions
- Data sharing features

Note: Make sure you have Chrome or Firefox installed and the appropriate WebDriver configured for Selenium tests.

### 5. Running Specific Test Files

You can run individual test files for targeted testing:

```bash
# To test model functionality
pytest tests/unit/test_models.py

# To test specific UI functionality
pytest tests/selenium/test_upload.py -m selenium
```
